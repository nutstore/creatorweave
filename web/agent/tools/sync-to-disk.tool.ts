/**
 * Sync-to-Disk Tool — agent-initiated flush of pending OPFS changes to the
 * real disk, through the full authorization chain.
 *
 * This is the SAFE counterpart to what exec's auto-flush used to do silently
 * (removed in this PR — see exec.tool.ts): writing to the real disk is a
 * risk-bearing operation, so it must prompt via the policy engine.
 *
 * Guarantees (redesign doc §3.6, as amended by the "authorized deletions"
 * follow-up):
 *   - Policy level 'prompt' → ToolAuthModal every time unless the user picked
 *     "Always allow for this conversation". A flush that includes delete-type
 *     changes uses a DELETION-SPECIFIC description (lists the paths) and its
 *     own memory key (`sync-to-disk:delete`), so a plain write grant can
 *     never silently cover deletions — the modal IS the informed consent,
 *     and the user's approval is honored: deletions ARE applied.
 *   - forceOverwrite is FORCED to false and not exposed to the LLM; conflicting
 *     paths are skipped per-file and reported (second line of defense,
 *     independent from the modal).
 *   - Only this AUTHORIZED channel may apply delete-type changes. Unattended
 *     paths (run-level auto-apply) still exclude them (see
 *     pending-disk-eligibility.ts for the fork).
 *   - Snapshot pipeline is reused (createApprovedSnapshotForPaths → syncToDisk
 *     → markSnapshotAsSynced) so synced — and deleted — files stay
 *     rollback-able (the snapshot captures deleted files' before-content).
